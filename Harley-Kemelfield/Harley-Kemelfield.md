Harley is an intern at SSW. He currently studies a Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Computing and Software Systems. Harley is learning a lot of skills, both technical and communication-based, and he is thoroughly enjoying the experience.

In his spare time, he has a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence, and is currently undertaking an online course about Machine Learning. At a recent SSW AI Hack Day, he decided to build a program that would predict if a song would be popular, with varying levels of success. He also enjoys chess and playing piano.
